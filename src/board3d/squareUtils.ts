/**
 * Converts algebraic chess notation (e.g. "e4") to world-space XZ coordinates.
 * Board is centred at origin. White's back rank (rank 1) is at z = -3.5.
 * File 'a' is at x = 3.5, file 'h' is at x = -3.5.
 * Three.js projects the white-side camera with world -X on screen-right, so
 * mirroring the file axis keeps White's queen visibly left of White's king.
